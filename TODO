- Try a better upsampling technique (not just copying values)
- I need to reach the baseline that is in the leaderboard (0.15), apparently, deleting only features

- DONE Measure entropy in test set and use those columns to train (didnt work better)
- DONE Brute force search of better columns to train (already implemented, very time consuming)
- Add noise features to filter useless columns and tune hyperparams of XGBOOst
- Search optimum setup on Country B, then in A. Country C already working great. Try:
    - DONE Grid Search of hyperparameters, 
    - DONE entropy (different threshold) (best is median)
    - DONE (testing original metrics now) correlation (cramers)


- DONE Avoid overfitting
- DONE Try categorizing contonious columns. (did not work better)
- PROGRESS Try adding features from indiv hhold
- Prepare class to train each country, like an experiment class. Use Hyperband to optimize hyperparams
